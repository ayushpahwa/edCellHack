ED Cell Hackthon

The main purpose of a hackthon is to innovate and create meaningful projects.
It revolves around finding a unique and better solution to everyday problems.
The most important thing of this hackthon was that it was very centric to one particular problem that was of improving the feedback system.

The idea of this hackthon was to create an interactive interface for students as well as teachers to give and analyse feedback respectively.
Often filling feedback form becomes very tedious for students and hence they end up giving wrong feedbacks.Analyzing them becomes more difficult.
   So,we came up with a very interactive feedback app with attendance integrated in it for students.Rather than taking attendance for last 10 minutes of a lecture,teacher can make a feedback form of all the things taught in that particular lecture.All students who all are present in the lecture will get that form in their app.As soon as the student fills the feedback he/she will automatically be marked present.Authentication of the student device will be done be audio qr as soon as the lecture starts. 

There will an analyzing app for teachers aswell.The app will get real time feedback from the students which will be converted into pie charts,graphs
for easy analysis.It will also focus on showing the progress and trend of the feedback.
We will also have an admin panel for the administrator.
The student app becomes platform independent as we are using react-native for front end.
We were not able to build the complete features for the app but
we believe that this is a very easy and feasible solution to feedback system which can be implemented in future.
